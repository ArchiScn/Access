# Arch-I-Scan Project Repositories
Arch-I-Scan Project has aimed to develop a tool for automating the classification of Roman terra sigillata, mainly Gaulish.
It comprises two subprojects:
1. The pilot study that used complete/near complete vessels in the collections of the London Museum.
2. The research that used sherds from the collections of MOLA, the Vindolanda Trust, University of Leicester Archaeology Services and the Colchester and Ipswich Museum Services materials.

The authors would like to thank the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK) for funding the Arch-I-Scan Project (Grant number AH/T001003/1) and the partner organisations for access to their terra sigillata collections.
 




This repository is used as an access point to three other repositories which contain the following material used in the paper "Learning from scarce information: using synthetic data to classify Roman fine ware pottery". 

The detailed description and files are presented in repositories:

1. [Access](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Access). It is this repository which joined all repositories and provide access to all repositories in one place.

1. [Collected images](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Collected_images). This repository contains images from The Museum of London antiquarian collection.

1. [Simulated images](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Simulated_images) used in pre-training of CNN models. This repository contains three sets of simulated images used for pre-training of CNN.

1. [Models](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Models) contains some formed CNN models.

The authors would like to thank the AHRC for funding the Arch-I-Scan project (Grant AH/T001003/1).
