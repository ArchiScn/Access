# Arch-I-Scan Project Repositories
Arch-I-Scan Project has aimed to develop a tool for automating the classification of Roman terra sigillata, mainly Gaulish.
It comprises two subprojects:
1. The pilot study that used complete/near complete vessels in the collections of the London Museum.
2. The research that used sherds from the collections of MOLA, the Vindolanda Trust, University of Leicester Archaeology Services and the Colchester and Ipswich Museum Services materials.

The authors would like to thank the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK) for funding the Arch-I-Scan Project (Grant number AH/T001003/1) and the partner organisations for access to their terra sigillata collections.
 
## Structure of repositories
All files related to **Main sherd project** can be found in [Sherd classification](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Sherd_classification) repository. This repository includes all CNN models, code to train these models and code to generate artificial data for model training.

Files related to **pilot study of whole vessels** can be found in three repositories. Spliting data into three repositories are caused by tecnical restrictions on repository size. There are three repositories:

1. [Collected images](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Collected_images). This repository contains images from The Museum of London antiquarian collection.

1. [Simulated images](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Simulated_images). This repository contains three sets of simulated images used for pre-training of CNN.

1. [Models](https://github.com/ArchiScn/Models) contains some formed CNN models.
